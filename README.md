# webpack/react-starter

This repo began as a GitHub fork of [webpack/react-starter](https://github.com/webpack/react-starter).

It is a boilerplate for quickly starting React/Webpack/MaterialUI projects. It features lightning fast development ala live reload.

The main differences from the original repo are:

- Data layer has been stripped out (not needed for static sites).
- Integrated Material UI ([callemall/material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui)).
- Created a basic Material UI project with site navigation and a couple of sample pages.
